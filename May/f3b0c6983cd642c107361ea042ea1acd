Cape Town - World Running Day is celebrated on June 1 and, for the second year in a row, Under Armour (UA) will host its UA “All Out Mile” event, at Green Point Stadium. The event will take place live and virtually in 14 countries around the world. Elite athletes, celebrities and the general public are invited to participate and strive for new personal bests across one mile (1.6km). All proceeds will be donated to charity. Managing director at Under Armour SA, Darren Cooke, said: “We are thrilled to have launched the Under Armour “All Out Mile” in SA for the second year running. “In an ode to celebrate one of the toughest distances, UA will further equip runners with invaluable training recommendations and tips to help athletes measure their runs and gauge their progress. “It’s going to be exciting to watch it unfold and we’re hoping that South Africans continue to light up the leaderboard.” Participants are required to sign up on the Under Armour website and join the FitRankings leaderboard. They then link to the UAMapMyRun App. After they complete their runs, their fastest times will be recorded on the leaderboard. matthew.petersen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
