Cape Town - The Koena Art Institute will host a grand reopening exhibition that will showcase and celebrate Khoi and San heritage through art. The main focus is on giving a contemporary take on the Khoi and San culture. The Koena Art Instit ute, at the heart of the bustling streets of Observatory, is a women-led NPC dedicated to the preservation of the Khoi and San heritage. Their focus is on celebrating creativity, openness, tolerance and generosity. The institute hosts established and upcoming artists whose work represents the Khoi and San heritage. Lukretia Booysen, the founder of the Koena Art Institute, says the reopening will be an opportunity for indigenous stories and voices to be heard. “We have built the institute with nothing. What we have been able to achieve is not the work of one person, but the culmination of a community of people who have brought their expertise, talent, knowledge and support to bring a new perspective to the cultural and creative landscape of our country,” Booysen said. She said the institute was a place where creatives went to tell their stories, share their culture and language and to teach through art. The Institute aims to open the space to creatives to host their own projects. Booysen said this year, the theme was about celebrating the evolution of indigenous arts. “We are presenting a perfect setting for art and culture enthusiasts and the broader social society to come together and celebrate different parts of the many indigenous Khoisan cultures,” she said. The opening takes place on Saturday June 12 at 42 Trill Road at 7pm.
