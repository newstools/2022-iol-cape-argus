Cape Town - The City has announced that the 44th edition of the Loerie Awards, Africa and the Middle East’s premier creative festival, will be hosted in Cape Town later this year. The Loeries is a non-profit company which works to recognise, reward, foster and inspire creative excellence in the brand communications industry.  Preetesh Sewraj, the Loeries’ CEO, said: “The Loeries is Africa’s premier creative festival. It aims to promote creative excellence that shows through individuals, communities and societies.” Cape Town will serve as more than just a scenic backdrop to the awards, and the Loeries plan to hold a number of development-focused initiatives within the City. “We moved the event to Cape Town in 2021 as a small event under Covid regulations. It was amazing working with the City and there was a warm reception to creative excellence. This year we are back under full scale and we want to explore ideas that people will be conducive to,” he said. Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said he was happy for Cape Town to welcome the creative excellence the Loerie Awards have to offer. “Cape Town is proud to be known as one of the creative capitals of the world. Generations of designers, writers, artists, musicians and others have drawn inspiration from our outstanding natural beauty, diverse cultural landscape, and vibrant communities and urban scene. I wish all nominees the best of luck, and all those attending the Creative Week an inspiring stay in our great city,” he said.  Sewraj said the Loeries would allow everyone to network and showcase their creative excellence in a safe environment that promoted innovation and creativity and to inspire young people to join the brand communications industry through a series of events.  The Loeries Creative Week will take place from October 3 to 8. matthew.petersen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
