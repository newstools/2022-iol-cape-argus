Cape Town - Applications for the 2023 Western Cape Provincial Treasury Bursary programme have officially opened for young people. Youth between the ages of 17 and 35 interested in pursuing careers in Economics, Finance, Accounting and Auditing, Supply Chain Management, Built Environment and Project Management (preferably Construction Economics/Management; Population Studies; Transport Economics or related courses), and Information Sciences, Data Science and Statistics, are encouraged to apply. These include Grade 12 learners and post graduate students. The bursary programme was launched in 2008 to provide an opportunity to access tertiary education through bursaries. The bursary application for 2023 will close on August 31 2022. Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC Mireille Wenger said the Western Cape Provincial Treasury is committed to addressing critical skills shortages and creating opportunities for young people in various fields within the treasury space. “I am ‘on the job for jobs’, and my overarching objective is to create the right conditions for economic growth and, therefore, job creation. Skills development, especially for our youth, is a critical factor in making this happen,” Wenger said. “By investing in our young people, not only will we recover from the impact of Covid-19, but we also lay the groundwork for economic growth that creates the jobs that we need to roll back poverty in the Western Cape.” Hout Bay community activist Roscoe Jacobs said bursaries are always welcomed. However, the problem lies in the access to information and how these types of opportunities reach the poor and working class close to the closure of applications.
