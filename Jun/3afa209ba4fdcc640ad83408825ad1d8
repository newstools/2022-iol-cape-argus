Cape Town - Pupils at Dennemere Primary School in Blue Downs are the beneficiaries of a personal computer lab, donated jointly by a nearby company and an endowment organisation. The school with a dedicated staff of 39, and an enrolment of more than 1 000 learners, has a proud tradition, its motto being: “Enter to learn, leave to serve”. The project was completed in April this year after endowment group Awqaf SA, as part of its expanded focus on infrastructure development through its Share the Care Campaign, set up the lab at the school. Awqaf SA has already done the same at educational institutions across South Africa. The computer lab was unveiled this week. Awqaf SA deputy CEO Mickaeel Collier said: “The world has evolved into an online digital reality through which individuals, communities and businesses engage. Establishing PC labs at schools that do not have proper functioning access to the online world therefore becomes imperative for our communities.” Privately owned Adenco Construction joined Awqaf SA in the project as part of its corporate social responsibility initiative to invest in the local community. Adenco Construction CEO Kashif Wicomb said: “Well-rounded education prepares and equips our youth for the challenges of the real world.” Dennemere Primary principal Wendy Leukus said it used an online curriculum-based application supplied by the Western Cape Education Department, with limited access to computers wherein learners could access the lab only once every two weeks.  “The opening of this lab will now allow our learners to access the PC lab once a week. This will bring untold benefits to our learners and the community at large,” she said.  Also at this week’s event was ANC provincial spokesperson on education, Muhammad Khalid Sayed, who hailed the PC lab, which was posthumously named after a Dennemere Primary former principal, Brits Abraham van Wyk.
