Cape Town - As World Oceans Day approaches tomorrow under the theme “Revitalisation: Collective Action for the Ocean”, activities are under way to celebrate the role of oceans in daily life and inspire action to protect them and the sustainable use of marine resources. Two Oceans Aquarium conservation and sustainability manager Helen Lockhart said the goal of the UN day was to protect 30% of the planet by 2030. People across the globe were urged to add their voices to the growing demand for more protection of the planet as climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat destruction and overexploitation threatened the sensitive ecosystems on which humans depend for their survival. “The 30x30 movement has already resulted in more than 90 countries committing to protect at least 30% of their land and ocean by 2030. “South Africans are urged to join the #30X30NOW campaign and sign the online petition which calls for the South African government to support this global goal,” Lockhart said. Lockhart said the Two Oceans Aquarium was not hosting any specific events on the day, but encouraged people to connect with the ocean in any way they could – be it by visiting the aquarium, going to the beach and enjoying the beauty of the ocean while picking up some litter, or trying to find out more about the ocean and how it supports all life on the planet. The Save Our Seas Foundation and Shark Education Centre together with Sirocco and The Beach Co-op have partnered to host a beach clean-up at the Kalk Bay Harbour tomorrow at 2pm for World Oceans Day. They were also heading back into the ocean for a snorkelling session with their marine explorers on June 10 and hosting an indoor information session with Dr Koebraa Peters providing information on the small things people could do in their daily lives to have a positive impact on the planet. Shark Spotters, in collaboration with the UCT biological sciences department, is hosting a beach clean-up at Muizenberg Beach on Saturday at 9am to bring awareness about the crucial role oceans play and the importance of conserving and protecting the marine environment. kristin.engel@inl.co.za Cape Argus
