Cape Town - There was much anticipation in the lead-up to the Under Armour All Out Mile event that took place at Green Point Athletics Track. It was the second consecutive year that Under Armour hosted the global event. The campaign started in May and concluded with the Global Running Day event on June 1. The event spanned 14 countries and Cape Town hosted the South African leg. The event was a huge success as many elite athletes, celebrities and the general public turned out in support. There were an estimated 400 competitors and 200 spectators in attendance. The five fastest celebs will get to select a charity of their choice to support. Some of the notable participants included Blitzbokke Captain Siviwe “Shakes” Soyizwapi, South African professional boxer Kevin Lerena and Stormers rugby player Ruhan Nel. “It has been amazing to see the All Out Mile campaign come to life. Those in attendance were treated to a superb display of running, with many setting new personal bests. It has been an honour to host some of the top elite middle-distance runners and at the same time bring the local running community together. Twenty-year-old South African favourite Prudence Sekgodiso was the fastest in the Women’s Elite race with a time of 04:43.17, while Kenyan athlete Justin Kemboi won the Men’s Elite category with a time of 3:59.02. Cooke said that one of the highlights of the evening was witnessing four men run sub-4-minute times in the Elite Men’s race, stating it was “an absolute privilege to bear witness to an incredible feat”. SAs Ashley Smith and Christopher Swart placed third and fourth behind Kenya’s Matthew Kipsang as the four runners to run below 4 minutes. matthew.petersen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
