Cape Town - From years of abuse and adversity to liberation through creative design – that’s the story of a Bonteheuwel grandmother who hopes to train others in similar situations to attain financial freedom. Audrey Morkel, 61, found the strength to leave an abusive relationship and is a creative designer and managing Audrey’s Factory, a design factory housed in a container at her home in Bonteheuwel.  “I was married for 30 years and at the age of 50, decided to divorce from my abuser. “The place I worked for closed down then I heard about Ikamva Design that was looking for a machinist. I went and they gave me the opportunity to bring out what was inside of me.” With previous experience as a machinist, having worked for years in the clothing and textile industry, Morkel, with Ikamva Design, was able to train mothers from mostly township areas prior to the Covid-19 lockdown. Morkel would prepare orders from her lounge before a structure was donated by NPO Ikamva Labantu, where items are manufactured for their Ikamva Design venture, a social enterprise that creates job opportunities for women in township neighbourhoods. “I enjoy training people and seeing how they grow in what I taught them and most of all to lift their spirits. “I want to be a trainer for the trainers to help other women who are abused to know who they are and what is in them, and to help with employment,” Morkel said. Ikamva Design co-founder, Melanie Peterhans, said: “Our role is to provide access to the market, as that is a big stumbling block for a lot of entrepreneurs. This is a partnership, and Audrey is supported both with access to the market and raw materials – giving her support and flow.” Special Valentine’s Day gifts can be purchased to support Morkel and Ikamva Design.
