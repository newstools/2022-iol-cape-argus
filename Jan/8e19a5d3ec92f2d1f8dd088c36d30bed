Cape Town - Police are investigating after an unknown man died on the railway line just before Southfield station on Wednesday afternoon in an apparent suicide. Metrorail acting spokesperson Nana Zenani said the incident fell outside of Metrorail's ambit and that the police were investigating the matter. “Our trains are static and only run on rail tracks. Unfortunately, with such tragedies the service must be suspended until the SAPS has finished investigations,” Zenani said. Police spokesperson Wesley Twigg confirmed that an inquest docket had been opened. Twigg said the circumstances surrounding the death of an unknown man, believed to be in his forties, were under investigation and that the incident occurred at around 4pm on Wednesday. “According to reports the victim jumped in front of an oncoming train between Southfield and Ottery railway stations,” Twig said. Southfield resident David Kleinveldt said he had been communicating with the ward councillor, who was waiting for the next of kin to come forward. The identity of the man was still unknown. “I live adjacent to the railway line and this guy was just sitting against the fence and waiting on the train, which would be about a few hundred metres from Southfield Station when it passes my place.  “This is not uncommon on this part of the line as there are quite a number of people that sit along the train line for whatever reason. This guy, however, just jumped flat in front of the train on to the lines when it got close to him.” Anyone with any information about this incident can contact the Diep River police on 021 710 7300, or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. shakirah.thebus@inl.co.za Cape Argus
