Cape Town - The fatal shooting of a homeless man by a City law enforcement officer has unearthed years of discontent between civil society organisations, opposing political parties and the City regarding its methods of handling homeless people in Cape Town. This follows several organisations and human rights activists who directly slammed the City of Cape Town, claiming that it was responsible for the fatal shooting of 38-year-old Dumisani Joxo in Chester Road, Rondebosch at the hands of law enforcement officer Luvolwethu Kati. In support of the homeless community of Chester Road, Ndifuna Ukwazi released a collective statement in support of the community rising call by the community of Chester street for the City to take responsibility for Joxo’s death at the hands of Kati. Ndifuna Ukwazi accused the City of being behind Joxo’s untimely death due to unchecked and escalating levels of violence towards the homeless. The organisation also demanded that the City properly investigate its Law Enforcement Unit concerning its legislative basis, the training of its officers, and the existence of an oversight mechanism.  As well as to arrange for Joxo’s memorial and his body’s repatriation to the Eastern Cape. In response, the City said while it was encouraging respect for due process of the police’s investigation into the incident, it was compelled to respond to erroneous statements by Ndifuna Ukwazi. “Ndifuna Ukwazi have already concluded as factual that the officer and his weapon were not under threat.  “However, witnesses at the scene corroborated that an altercation involving several persons occurred which led to the officer’s weapon being discharged. “Despite not being on the scene at the time, Ndifuna Ukwazi are campaigning for endorsements of their version of events outside of due legal processes,” the City said. Meanwhile, the ANC caucus called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to “stamp his authority” on Cape Town metro police. nomalanga.tshuma@inl.co.za Cape Argus
