Last week, the first trailer for its new series “Moon Knight” was released, with the show set to premiere on March 30. Unlike previous Marvel series, which were based on existing characters from the company's pre-2019 feature films, “Moon Knight” charts a new path, with a totally new set of characters and a storyline that has no clear initial connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Starring Oscar Isaac as Marc Spector, an ex-soldier who suffers from dissociative identity disorder, the action-adventure series set against the backdrop of modern and ancient Egypt finds the spectral superhero’s multiple identities thrust into a deadly war of the gods. He becomes the conduit for the Egyptian moon god Khonshu, which only further exacerbates Marc’s anxiety over his mental illness. The almost two-minute-long trailer, set to the backdrop of Kid Cudi's “Day 'n' Night”, introduces viewers to the protagonist who isn't able to differentiate between his normal life and his dreams.
