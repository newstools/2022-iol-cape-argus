Cape Town - Police investigating the death of a 47-year-old man who died while running on the contour path just below Devil’s Peak on Table Mountain. Western Cape Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) and the Western Cape Department of Health EMS/AMS rescue helicopter retrieved the body of the man who had been running on Saturday morning. WSAR spokesperson Johann Marais said: “WSAR was busy with an exercise when we were alerted to an incident by another trail runner, who ran around to call for assistance. A technical rescuer and two paramedics had been short-hauled by the helicopter as part of the exercise. “They were immediately flown to the collapsed runner. Upon arrival, rescuers noted that someone had already begun performing CPR. Unfortunately, the attempts were not successful, and the patient was declared deceased,” Marais said. While WSAR is not certain what could have led to the runner’s death, the search and rescue service group said he might have suffered a heart attack. “The runner may have had a heart attack. However, we are waiting for the post-mortem to determine the cause of death,” Marais said. Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said: “Rondebosch police attended a complaint of a sudden death near to Devil’s Peak on Saturday morning. Upon arrival, they found the body of an unknown male. “The victim had been declared deceased on the scene by the medical personnel. Rondebosch police registered an inquest for further investigation.” nomalang.tshuma@inl.co.za Cape Argus
