Listening to President Cyril Ramaphosa waxing lyrical about efforts to resurrect the ANC to its former glory during the ANC’s 110 year birthday celebrations was painful and nothing but pie in the sky. The ANC doesn’t just have a few dissidents, it is split right down the middle and efforts to mend it have about as much chance of success as Humpty Dumpty had when he fell off the wall. CR should be reminded of the date March 15, 44BC, historically known as the Ides of March when Julius Caesar was stabbed to death in the Senate by his enemies within.  The ANC has its own Marcus Brutus, head conspirator in the treachery that ended Caesar’s life. We all know who this is. Hopes within the CR faction that the ANC’s own Marcus Brutus will vanish into the mists of time is wishful thinking and is not going to happen. The problem is that CR is too soft on his political enemies who have their knives out for him to return the country to Zumafication. Suggestions by CR that only the ANC is capable of returning the country to a sound footing are absurd and ridiculous as it is the very same ANC that destroyed it.  No doubt, CR is a capable leader but he is hamstrung by those in his party who want him out; herein lies his problem. Beware the Ides of March. * Colin Bosman, Newlands. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
