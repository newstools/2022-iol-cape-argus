While people may be spending for Christmas, the price of school uniforms is escalating due to the distributions in the economy brought by Covid 19. However, schools can no longer force parents to buy school uniforms at a specific supplier. A consent agreement was recently reached between the Competition Tribunal and uniform supplier McCullagh and Bothwell, ending an exclusivity supply agreement deal. The agreement aims to increase competition and ensure cheaper prices.  The decision came years after the investigations into complaints made by parents who said they were forced to buy school uniforms from a specific supplier. The new agreement effectively terminates all exclusive supply agreements on the procurement of school uniforms while guaranteeing parents and learners choice and an opportunity to shop around for competitive prices for uniforms and learning materials. We priced uniforms for grades 1 and 8 learners as they will be starting a new journey in their schooling lives.
