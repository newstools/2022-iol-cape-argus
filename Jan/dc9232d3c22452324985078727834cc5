Cape Town - The case of a 37-year-old man accused of being involved in a cash-in-transit heist was postponed until January 12 for bail information at Worcester Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Sebenzile Macebo made a brief appearance on Wednesday, where he was charged with armed robbery. This after he handed himself to the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation on Monday.
