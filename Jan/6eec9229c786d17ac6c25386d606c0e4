Cape Town - Fewer than two days after police arrested four suspects for the robbery of a post office in De Doorns during a high-speed chase that ended in Paarl, police in Caledon have arrested four other suspects for a similar offence. The suspects, aged between 25 and 35 years old, were apprehended by police in Zwelihle, Hermanus, following their brazen robbery of a post office in Plein Street, Caledon, on Wednesday morning. Police spokesperson André Traut said: “Initial reports indicate that the suspects held the staff at the post office at gunpoint, and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash in a VW Golf. “An investigation led the police to a residence in Zwelihle where the suspects were found in possession of stolen money and an unlicensed 9mm pistol. “Once charged, the suspects are due to appear in the Caledon Magistrate’s Court on charges of business robbery and the possession of an unlicensed firearm,” Traut added. In a separate incident in Harare, police arrested three suspects for the illegal possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Meanwhile, in Bishop Lavis, police are seeking the assistance of the public to trace resident Jonathan Adams. Adams is believed to have transported a 32-year-old man to Vanguard Day Hospital on Wednesday after an incident that took place in Bonteheuwel. Police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi said: “While attending to a complaint at the hospital, police were informed that the victim had been brought in by Adams. The victim had sustained burn wounds to his wrist and was declared deceased by the medical personnel." "We are requesting the assistance of the mentioned person or anyone with information of what transpired who can assist with the investigation," Swartbooi said. Anyone with information can contact investigating officer Warrant Officer Rochelle van Schalkwyk at 082 312 7221 or Crime Stop at 08600 10111. Cape Argus
