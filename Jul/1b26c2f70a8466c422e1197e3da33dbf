Cape Town - The ZipZap Winter Tots Camp is back for the school holidays from 4-8 July as children will enjoy a week of circus festivities and fun games in a safe and non-competitive environment. Amy Wood, digital marketer at Zip Zap Circus, said the camp offers a unique experience for children. “The camp is designed to introduce children to circus techniques through games and play in a safe space. Throughout the week children will receive encouragement in a non-competitive, nurturing environment. The aim is to build a foundation for strength, flexibility, balance, co-ordination, focus, posture, teamwork, and determination. Children at any level of physical development and skill are welcome,” she said. The camp is open to children aged 5-7, where they will participate in circus activities such as juggling and acrobatics, while there is a live performance by ZipZap’s circus professionals for entertainment. There are 26 children who are attending this camp and many of the parents are excited at what the children will be able to learn at the camp. One of the parents, Jorn Das, said:  “Samuel is seven and he is loving it. He is so excited to be learning circus tricks. He loved the Zip-Zap performances and has been pretending to be in the circus. This has been a great opportunity for him to see what it's like and to gain confidence and strength in his body and to see what he can do.” At the end of the week, the kids get to take part in a show-and-tell performance as a culmination of what they have learnt over the course of the week. With the lifting of Covid restrictions, ZipZap have opened their doors to performing again. Their roadshow, Moya, recently performed at the National Arts Festival and Slapstick will return to perform in August this year. matthew.petersen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
