Cape Town - Celebrating resilience through collaboration will be the theme of this year’s Hospital Association of South Africa (Hasa) conference. The association will host its conference at the Century City Conference and Hotel, Century City, Cape Town, on August 1 and 2. The association represents most private hospitals in the country, with members including hospital groups Netcare, Life Healthcare, Mediclinic, and the National Hospital Network – an independent hospital collective of more than 200 facilities. Local and international health experts attend the annual conference and exhibition, which was last held in 2019, skipping two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hasa public affairs executive Mark Peach said topics on the agenda include legislative reform, nursing, innovation, human resources for health, health communication, and the possibilities presented by collaboration, with speakers drawn from the government, private hospitals, academia, and consulting. “In our view, the single most valuable lesson emerging from the pandemic is that if we all work together, we can come through even the harshest challenges. We collaborated when the virus raged through the country, and despite our tragic losses, we have come this far,” Peach said. Previous conferences have attracted national and regional policymakers and regulators, academics, private and public sector hospital and nursing services managers, non-governmental organisations, clinical and quality control managers, medical staff, medical device and service supplies, consumer champions, and health-care media. Hasa CEO Dr Dumisani Bomela said: “Our annual conference returns at a time when there is robust debate about the shape and scale of health-care reform. Our programme captures aspects of these debates. Perhaps this is why the excitement surrounding the event is so palpable.” Registration details can be found at https://conferencehasa.co.za Cape Argus
