Cape Town - About 40 Cape Flats children will be enjoying a special Mandela Day treat on Monday. This is thanks to a collaboration between the Cape Argus, Weekend Argus and GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World in partnership with CineCentre, Silver Dollar Spur and Colapathy. The Mandela Day initiative started by the newspapers will see the children, accompanied by childminders, watch the latest Minions movie, Minions: Rise of Gru at CineCentre followed by lunch at the Silver Dollar Spur and be sponsored with a surprise “goody bag” from GrandWest and Colapathy. Cape Argus editor Aziz Hartley said: “We decided to have an event with children this year. “We all know how much Madiba loved and adored children, and in our communities there are countless young children who do not get an opportunity like this – to be given a real treat and just have fun. We are not able to do it for all of them, but we are very happy about bringing joy to some young ones.” GrandWest marketing manager Nikki Botha said Mandela Day was a strong reminder for all about how important it was to take action, to inspire change and to make a difference in the lives of others. “We at GrandWest were delighted to offer our resources to this great initiative. When the Cape Argus first approached us about Mandela Day, we loved the concept and immediately agreed to come on board. “It’s such a good idea and our concessionaires were equally quick to offer their support. These 40 young children will have a day of pure joy that they will remember for many years to come,” Botha said. Cape Argus marketing officers Olwethu Bhozo, said: “We would like to reflect – a space, a day, 67 minutes or even a moment and spread the spirit of ubuntu by celebrating the day with the people closest to the late Tatamkhulu Nelson Mandela’s heart: children, the future and hope of South Africa.” Cape Argus
